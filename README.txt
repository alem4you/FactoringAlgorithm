This program receives in input a big integer number 
product of two prime numbers p and q. By applying the
quadratic sieve algorithm the program is able to return
the prime numbers that generated it.

The program runs in this way:

FactoringAlgorithm.jar -n number [-o]

where -o enables the step by step output. The algorithm 
prints in the terminal the result and the time needed to
decompose the number.
